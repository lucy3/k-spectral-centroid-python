K-Spectral Centroid: Cluster Time Series by Shape, in Python

This rewrites the MATLAB implementation found here: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ksc.html

This implementation is invariant to time. That is, it does not search through different values of $q$, as defined in the original paper: http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/984/1/paper-memeshapes.pdf
